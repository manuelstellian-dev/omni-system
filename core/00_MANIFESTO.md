# OMNI PROJECT MANIFESTO

## 1. THE VISION
OMNI is not a coding assistant. It is an **Autonomous Software Architect and Builder**.
Current tools (Cursor, Aider, Windsurf) are "force multipliers" for humans. OMNI is the "force".
The goal is to move the human from "Loop-in-the-Code" to "Loop-on-the-Spec".

## 2. CORE PHILOSOPHY
* **Zero Friction:** From intent to deployment in one command. No manual config.
* **Opinionated Excellence:** We do not ask "What linter do you want?". We enforce the strictest standards (e.g., Biome/ESLint Strict, TypeScript Strict Mode).
* **Self-Healing:** If a build fails, OMNI fixes it. If a test fails, OMNI rewrites the code. The user is never presented with a broken state.
* **Deterministic Output:** Given the same spec, OMNI produces a predictable, production-grade result.
* **No Toys:** No emojis in commit messages. No concise code snippets. Full, robust implementation only.

## 3. THE STANDARD OF "DONE"
A feature is not "done" when the code is written. It is done when:
1.  Code is written and statically analyzed (0 errors).
2.  Unit and Integration tests are passed.
3.  Documentation (README/ADR) is updated.
4.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is generated.
5.  The system is deployed to a preview environment.

## 4. COMPETITIVE EDGE
We make existing AI CLI tools look like prototypes. OMNI provides the entire SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) in a box.
